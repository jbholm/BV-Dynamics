Vaginal Microbiome and Immune Responses to Metronidazole in BV

This study analyzed metagenomic and immune marker profiles of seven individuals before, during, and after a 7-day course of metronidazole treatment for bacterial vaginosis (BV). Treatment reduced BV-associated bacteria and immune marker levels, with distinct early (days 1-4) and late (days 5-7) phases. Post-treatment variability in microbial and immune marker profiles demonstrated a rapid resurgence of certain BV-associated bacteria, highlighting the need for additional strategies like probiotics to maintain a healthy vaginal microbiome. The study found significant host and microbial influences on immune response variance, with IP-10 and sEcad highly correlated with the vaginal microbiome. The findings identify the optimal timing for administering live biotherapeutics to restore D-lactic acid-producing Lactobacillus species dominance and underscore the complexity of BV infection and treatment response among different people.
